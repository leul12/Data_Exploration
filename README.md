# this Repo is dedicated for my journey in the world of Data visualization automation and the likes of it

## there will be plenty of cases from simple data crawling cleaning to machine learning senarios happening in this repo (hopefully in the future)

# 1. kaggle-titanic üõ•Ô∏è

This is the legendary Titanic ML competition ‚Äì the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.
The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

# 2 .tweet_scraping_and_exporting üê¶

in this use case I will try to cover how to get social media data, index it, clear it and export it to a csv file for further manuplation open `tweet_scraping_and_exporting.ipynb` file for detail information.

# 3. tweet_visulization üñºÔ∏è

this one is a continuation of **2** let's try to do some kind of analysis that is exported from step **2**

# By the end of this Advanture, you‚Äôll be ready to

* Split and filter text data in preparation for analysis
* Analyze word frequency
* Find concordance and collocations using different methods
* Perform quick sentiment analysis with NLTK‚Äôs built-in classifier
* Define features for custom classification
* Use and compare classifiers for sentiment analysis with NLTK
